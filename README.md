# Multi-threads server
"# Multi-threads-server" 

Built a multi-threaded server with TCP protocol under Linux operation system, containing a proof-of-work solver based on SHA-256 for the Hashcash mining algorithm used in Bitcoin

Used POSIX pthread library including mutex lock to handle multi-client requests andmulti-thread synchronization, which resulted in the improvement of response speed and stability of the server
